Hi Ruby,

I came across your profile and thought you might be a fit for some roles we are hiring for and wanted to take a moment to introduce myself and Pickle to you as we are a growing company using technology to disrupt the home security space and are looking for great engineers to join our team.

Dear Ruby,

I hope this message finds you well today. The reason I wanted to reach out today is because we're working on a fast-growing, fintech startup. In the role you would be working in a diverse team of engineers of varying experience levels to deliver quality software that is used by customers and colleagues. The Tech you would be using is primarily Javascript (React, Node) and cloud tech like AWS.

I am not sure of your current situation, but would you be open to speaking more about this opportunity? I hope to hear back soon.

Hi Ruby!

Itâ€™s Polly from Aptible :). We saw immense success in 2020 and we plan on making 2021 even bigger. 

Since our work lives in cloud architecture and we already have a robust remote culture in place, weâ€™ve been very fortunate that the Covid-19 crisis has not been as disruptive as it could have been. 

Iâ€™d love to chat with you and learn what your interests are!

Hi Ruby,

Hi Ruby,

I came across your profile and saw that you recently moved into your position at Cool Company, I hope all is well. I am reaching out because I currently have a UI lead position available in Boston, Ma.

I look forward to speaking with you Ruby!

Hi Ruby,

Sketchbox is currently looking for Technical Solution Engineers for our Boston team and I feel that your background in JavaScript and HTML would set you up perfectly for success.

It is a very unique role that is critical to the integration and management of our technology - it requires a large amount of internal interaction across multiple groups, and external client engineering teams. This is a great opportunity to have more client interactions and serve as a product knowledge expert for the entire company.

We have a best in class product, amazing culture, beautiful office in downtown Boston, and a slide from the 15th to the 14th floor!

If interested, what day would work best for you to connect?
